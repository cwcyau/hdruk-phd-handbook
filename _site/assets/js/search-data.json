I am excited to welcome you to the start of your doctoral studies with Health Data Research UK (HDRUK) and our seven partner universities: Queen’s Belfast, Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford and University College London. The programme is funded by the Wellcome Trust and champions their principles of scientific excellence and changing research culture for the better. Each of you is both a member of the HDRUK community and a postgraduate research student at your university. What this will mean in practice is somthing we will discover together in the months ahead as a group – this is a ground breaking and novel PhD programme. My hope and expectation is that each of you will benefit from being a member of two distinct but overlapping cohorts leveraging both your local university environment and the national structure of HDRUK to become the future leaders of health data science. Over the four years of your studies you will work towards developing and implementing an exciting research project at your university but, with our support at HDRUK, we hope to enhance that experience by helping to increase the level of your scientific insight through access to national level expertise and infrastructure, strengthen its impact on the public and patients and to support your development as individuals. We wish you the best at the very start of this journey. Professor Christopher Yau, Programme Director . ",

Do not exceed 700 words. References . Give the citation in full, including title of paper and all authors. Outputs management plan . All Wellcome PhD programme students are expected to manage their research outputs in a way that will achieve the greatest health benefit, maximising the availability of research data, software and materials with as few restrictions as possible. Guidance on developing an outputs management plan, which includes a link to some good examples, is available here. If an outputs management plan is not required, explain why. Additional information .

The purpose of the Year 1 Review Panel is to: . | Verify that the candidate has been actively engaged in the Year 1 Training Programme | Evaluate the proposed PhD Research Project | Recommend that the candidate proceed to the second year of the programme. | . Prerequisites . The candidate shall submit a written PhD research proposal no less than one week before the review panel. The Review Panel . The review panel shall consist of no less than three academic representatives to include: . | The HDRUK-Turing PhD Director (or nominated representative) | The University Lead (or nominated representative) for the candidates’ institution | An independent academic representative not based at the candidates’ institution. | . No members of the proposed supervision team shall be present on the review panel and suitable substitutes will be put in place if any of the above are proposed supervisors. Evaluation Criteria . The panel shall: . | Evaluate if the proposed research falls under the scientific remit of the HDRUK-Turing PhD Programme. | Judge if the proposed research is feasible and that a sufficient body of work could be achieved within three years to permit the award of a doctorate. | Determine if the supervision team has the appropriate range of expertise, experience and availability to suitably guide the candidate. | Verify that the necessary data and/or computational resources are in place (or there is a credible plan for these to be in place) to accomplish the research objectives. | Identify if a suitable output management strategy is in place to allow appropriate dissemination of the research outputs. | Consider if appropriate ethical and/or research protocols are in place to allow the work to be conducted. | Determine if the proposed research expenses are justified. | Evaluate if public-patient engagement has been considered. | . Decisions . At the conclusion of the review, the panel shall make one of three following decisions: . | Proceed to Year 2. The panel considers there to be no major issues with the proposal and no (or very minor) corrections are required. | Minor revisions. The panel determines that the proposal is sound but some minor revisions are required to clarify or improve the proposal. | Major revisions. The panel considers that there are significant flaws in the research proposal and a major revision or alternative proposal is required. | . If revisions are required, the candidate will be provided with advice and guidance as to the additional steps required. It is considered unlikely that major revisions would be required if the candidates routinely consult with their University Lead or the Programme Directors during the project proposal development. Public-Patient Review . HDRUK is heavily invested in ensuring the public is consulted about the research that it undertakes. You will present your proposals to a specially convened public-patient advisory group and respond to feedback as part of your proposal development. Scientific Remit . HDRUK research currently covers a broad range of areas but proposed research projects must involve quantitative-based research which is likely to involve one or more of the following: . | The design and implementation of novel analysis methods, | Use of electronic health records, | Integrative analysis across different health data modalities, | Investigation of epidemiology or population research questions, | Investigation of the causes of human disease. | . Primary research activities should not include experimental (laboratory-based) work, qualitative studies or extensive data collection though some limited exposure to these activities are permitted for training and experience purposes. Proposals focusing on non-human organisms or have a specific focus on understanding fundamental human biology may not be appropriate. Pure methodology projects should be motivated by health data research problems or indicate a path to utility for research applications. Supervisory Support . Supervision teams are expected to contain the range and depth of expertise required to support the student in their personal and research development. Otherwise, there are no restrictions on the constitution of supervision teams beyond the normal requirements set by individual universities on supervisor eligibility. Note - due to the COVID-19 pandemic, students may not have had normal interactions with their universities and the opportunity to meet academics. Therefore some flexibility can be shown to allow supervision teams to grow during the PhD. ",

An important part of your research proposal will be the lay abstract and the addition of appropriate public-patient co-design and engagement activities. We will leverage the extensive experience of HDRUK to support your training in this area through our PPIE team and our Public Advisory Board to ensure your proposals are written and presented suitably for wider audiencs. Proposal Review Panel . Your thesis project proposals will be assessed by both the Programme Director and a multi-institutional panel of University Leads or External Experts. The aim of the viva is to provide feedback on your project so that you may improve your research plans (where necessary) before the proposal is submitted to Wellcome. You may submit your proposal for review in either June or August of your first year. The first deadline allows time for substantial revisions should the project be assessed have deficiencies or permit PhD studies to begin by the summer. The second deadline allows students flexibility to spend longer on first year activities to support project development but does not leave substantial time for revisions should proposals be unsuitable. HDRUK approved Research Proposals must be submitted by the 30 September to Wellcome at the end of your first year. Failure to do so may jeopardise continuation of funding support. ",
