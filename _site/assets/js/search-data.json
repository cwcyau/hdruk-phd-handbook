I am excited to welcome you to the start of your doctoral studies with Health Data Research UK (HDRUK) and our seven partner universities: Queen’s Belfast, Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford and University College London. The programme is funded by the Wellcome Trust and champions their principles of scientific excellence and changing research culture for the better. Each of you is both a member of the HDRUK community and a postgraduate research student at your university. What this will mean in practice is somthing we will discover together in the months ahead as a group – this is a ground breaking and novel PhD programme. My hope and expectation is that each of you will benefit from being a member of two distinct but overlapping cohorts leveraging both your local university environment and the national structure of HDRUK to become the future leaders of health data science. Over the four years of your studies you will work towards developing and implementing an exciting research project at your university but, with our support at HDRUK, we hope to enhance that experience by helping to increase the level of your scientific insight through access to national level expertise and infrastructure, strengthen its impact on the public and patients and to support your development as individuals. We wish you the best at the very start of this journey. Professor Christopher Yau, Programme Director . ",

At the end of Year One, each student will have an interview with the Programme Directors and members of the Executive Board. We will discuss your engagement and contribution to the Year One Training Programme (via your Evidence-based Training Record) and the contents of your proposed research plan for Years 2-4. The outcome will be one of the following (note that all interview outcomes are conditional on home university requirements also being fulfilled): . | Approved: the student may progress to Year 2 of the PhD programme. | Request for Revision: the student has engaged well with the training programme but is required to revise their PhD research plan and resubmit for review. | Request for New Research Plan: the student has engaged well with the training programme but is required to devise a new PhD research plan and resubmit for review. | Cause for Concern: the interview panel has identified issues related to your engagement with the PhD programme and will advise a further consultation with yourself and your home university to determine the next steps. | . Cause for concern may arise due to factors such as unexplained or unauthorised absence, failure to participate in training activities, poor conduct when engaging with other students or staff. In exceptional circumstances, it could lead to the termination of your studentship. If at any stage of your PhD, you face personal or professional circumstances requiring extra support, please see the Student Support area for ways to find help.

You may submit your proposal for review in either June or August of your first year.
