The purpose of the Year 1 Review Panel is to: . | Verify that the candidate has been actively engaged in the Year 1 Training Programme | Evaluate the proposed PhD Research Project | Recommend that the candidate proceed to the second year of the programme. | . Prerequisites . The candidate shall submit a written PhD research proposal no less than one week before the review panel. The Review Panel . The review panel shall consist of no less than three academic representatives to normally include: . | The HDRUK-Turing PhD Director (or nominated representative) | The University Lead (or nominated representative) for the candidates’ institution | An independent academic representative not based at the candidates’ institution. | . No members of the proposed supervision team shall be present on the review panel and suitable substitutes will be put in place if any of the above are proposed supervisors or specific technical expertise is required. Review Process . Each review will last no longer than 30 minutes. The candidate will be asked to open the review with a 5-minute overview of their proposed project (slides optional but no more than 3). The Review Panel will then ask the candidates questions regarding the research proposal in the remaining time. Following questions, candidates will be asked to leave the meeting. Candidates will be informed of the outcome by the Programme Director or their appointed representative usually on the same day. Evaluation Criteria . The panel shall: . | Evaluate if the proposed research falls under the scientific remit of the HDRUK-Turing PhD Programme. | Judge if the proposed research is feasible and that a sufficient body of work could be achieved within three years to permit the award of a doctorate. | Determine if the supervision team has the appropriate range of expertise, experience and availability to suitably guide the candidate. | Verify that the necessary data and/or computational resources are in place (or there is a credible plan for these to be in place) to accomplish the research objectives. | Identify if a suitable output management strategy is in place to allow appropriate dissemination of the research outputs. | Consider if appropriate ethical and/or research protocols are in place to allow the work to be conducted. | Determine if the proposed research expenses are justified. | Evaluate if public-patient engagement has been considered. | . Decisions . At the conclusion of the review, the panel shall make one of three following decisions: . | Proceed to Year 2. The panel considers there to be no major issues with the proposal and no (or very minor) corrections are required. | Minor revisions. The panel determines that the proposal is sound but some minor revisions are required to clarify or improve the proposal. | Major revisions. The panel considers that there are significant flaws in the research proposal and a major revision or alternative proposal is required. | . If revisions are required, the candidate will be provided with advice and guidance as to the additional steps required. It is considered unlikely that major revisions would be required if the candidates routinely consult with their University Lead or the Programme Directors during the project proposal development. Public-Patient Review . HDRUK is heavily invested in ensuring the public is consulted about the research that it undertakes. You will present your proposals to a specially convened public-patient advisory group and respond to feedback as part of your proposal development. ",

Pure methodology projects should be motivated by health data research problems or indicate a path to utility for research applications. Supervisory Support . Supervision teams are expected to contain the range and depth of expertise required to support the student in their personal and research development. Otherwise, there are no restrictions on the constitution of supervision teams beyond the normal requirements set by individual universities on supervisor eligibility. ",

You may submit your proposal for review in either June or August of your first year. The first deadline allows time for substantial revisions should the project be assessed have deficiencies or permit PhD studies to begin by the summer.

The purpose of the immersion week is to introduce specific themes, topics or real-world challenges of importance in health data science to PhD students within the environment in which problem holders are based. ### Participants Each immersion week will consist of between 6-12 HDRUK PhD students with further external non-HDRUK PhD students recruited where Host organisation agreed and can support the numbers. Students will predominantly be in their first year of doctoral studies. ### Content Host organisations are free to choose event content and delivery style but are advised to consult HDRUK in case of overlap (e.g. Host wants to provide an introduction to survival analysis but participants have previously been introduced to survival analysis through previous studies). Examples of content from previous past events include: - Introductory lectures which are used to explain new concepts and methods, - Site tours where relevant physical examination of facilities and environments is useful, - Computational exercises including small data analysis or programming tasks, - Student-led research activities where students are direct to conduct short research pieces, - Group-based activities including reading groups. - Interactive discussions with experts. - Careers-related discussions. ### Participant Information Participating students can be assumed to have graduate-level competencies in mathematics and computing. No prior experience in the life or medical sciences can be assumed. ### Further connections Hosts are encouraged to engage with HDRUK students and to offer suggestions for further direct collaborations. This could be via: 1. Short 3-6 month individual or groups projects as part of the HDRUK PhD training programme. 2. Internships as formal employees or members of Host organisations. 3. Full PhD research collaborations. HDRUK PhD students have considerable autonomy over their training programme in Year 1 and are able to take on project work throughout Year 1 but particularly during the period June-September at the end of their first year when there is no programmed content. ## Event Information Hosts will be required to provide the following information during the development and delivery of the immersion : |Item|Description|---|---|Lead Contact|Name and contact details of person(s) responsible for the design and delivery of the immersion week at the Host.|Event Location|The location of the immersion week.|Access Information|Hosts will be required to provide information regarding access to the event (e.g. security passes) including that relevant to any participants who may have access requirements. Any local transport information would also be appreciated particularly where there are no normal public transport routes. |Background reading|If relevant, prior reading and literature should be provided *at least* two weeks prior to the immersion week.|On-site protocols|Hosts should alert HDRUK to any health & safety requirements and procedures related to the event. It is assumed that most immersion weeks will consist of office- or lecture room-based activities. Hosts should provide HDRUK with information about any clinical, laboratory or outdoor activities that maybe involved.| ## Arrangements All travel, accommodation and subsistence costs for HDRUK PhD students are provided for by HDRUK. Non-HDRUK participants will be supported under different arrangement. Hosts will bear no responsibility for arranging or financially supporting travel, accommodation and subsistence for participants. Hosts will provide the knowledge, expertise and time required for the running and delivery of the immersion week at no charge to HDRUK or participants unless by prior arrangement. ## Expected Timelines |Time|Milestone|---|---|At least 3 months before event | Agreement in principle between Host and HDRUK to deliver the immmersion week |At least 6 weeks before event | Host to agree high-level training themes with HDRUK to advertise for any external participants. |At least 3 weeks before event| Host to provide draft agenda. HDRUK to arrange travel and accommodation.|At least 1 week before event| HDRUK to provide final participant list to Host.
