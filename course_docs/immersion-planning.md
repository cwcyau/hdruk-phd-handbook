# Immersion Planning

** This information is for immersion week host organisation **

## About

Immersion weeks are 3-4 day residential events co-organised by HDRUK with a Host Organisation. The purpose of the immersion week is to introduce specific themes or topics of importance in health data science to HDRUK (and external) PhD students within the environment in which problem holders are based.

## Event Information

Each immersion week will consist of between 6-12 HDRUK PhD students with potentially further external students recruited where Host organisation agreed and can support the numbers.

Hosts will be required to provide the following information during the development and delivery of the immersion :

|Item|Description|
|---|---|
|Lead Contact|Name and contact details of person(s) responsible for the design and delivery of the immersion week at the Host.|
|Event Location|The location of the immersion week.|
|Access Information|Hosts will be required to provide information regarding access to the event (e.g. security passes) including that relevant to any participants who may have access requirements. Any local transport information would also be appreciated particularly where there are no normal public transport routes. |
|Background reading|If relevant, prior reading and literature should be provided *at least* two weeks prior to the immersion week.|
|On-site protocols|Hosts should alert HDRUK to any health & safety requirements and procedures related to the event. It is assumed that most immersion weeks will consist of office- or lecture room-based activities. Hosts should provide HDRUK with information about any clinical, laboratory or outdoor activities that maybe involved.|

## Arrangements

All travel, accommodation and subsistence costs for HDRUK PhD students are provided for by HDRUK. Non-HDRUK participants will be supported under different arrangement. 

Hosts will bear no responsibility for arranging or financially supporting travel, accommodation and subsistence for participants. Hosts will provide the knowledge, expertise and time required for the running and delivery of the immersion week at no charge to HDRUK or participants unless by prior arrangement.
