## About the Director of Studies

The role of the **Director of Studies** (DoS) is to support you personally through your studies from HDR UK. This can include both academic and non-academic issues. They can provide impartial advice distinct from your university support systems as well as be the direct contact for matters concerning HDR UK. They are normally responsible for monitoring your progression through your studies.

If you require advice on anything that might be affecting your studies, your current research or future ambitions, please contact your DoS.

Director of Studies will normally be one of the HDRUK PhD Programme Directors but other support maybe offer based on individual circumstances.

## Allocations

The following are the Director of Studies allocations for each student. We try to match based on a combination of geographical location, research interests and impartiality factors.
