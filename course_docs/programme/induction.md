## Overview

Your induction will consist of two parts:

1. Your enrolment and induction at your home university,
2. Your induction at HDR UK.

Your enrolment and induction at your home university will be administered and handled by your home university who will provide information and instructions. We typically allow students to enrol at their home universities first before beginning HDR UK induction. This is because your home university will be your degree awarding institution (and for international students your official visa sponsors).

Please note that stipends and other administrative matters relating to the PhD programme are described [here](https://cwcyau.github.io/hdruk-phd-handbook/course_docs/admin.html). 

## Things to do

### ORCID

It is a condition of your programme participation that you register with [ORCID](https://orcid.org/). 

<span style="color: blue;">Please create an ORCID account for yourself no later than **1 October** in the year of your entry.</span>

### Wellcome Grant Tracker 

Your studentship will either come from funding received from Wellcome or Health Data Research UK. The nature of your funding source does not affect your programme experience but those in receipt of funds that derive from Wellcome must create a [Wellcome Grant Tracker](https://wtgrants.wellcome.org/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f) account.

You can check if you are required to register for an account (i.e. you are in receipt of Wellcome funds) [here](DoS.md).

<span style="color: blue;">Please create an [Wellcome Grant Tracker](https://wtgrants.wellcome.org/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f) account for yourself, if required to do so, no later than **1 October** in the year of your entry.</span>

Please store your log-in details carefully as you will need to log in to this account next year to submit your PhD proposal.

### HDR UK E-mail and other services

You will be provided with an HDR UK e-mail address after you have enrolled at your university. The e-mail address will be used for all official communications during your period of study. It will also enable your access to the HDR UK Slack group, the [Box](https://www.box.com/) file-sharing service and the expenses system.

<span style="color: blue;">Please contact [phd@hdruk.ac.uk](phd@hdruk.ac.uk) after your university enrolment to request activation of your HDR UK e-mail. You should use your official university e-mail address to confirm your enrolment has taken place.</span>

### HDR UK Director of Studies

You will be assigned an HDR UK Director of Studies (DoS) who will be your main academic contact. Student-DoS allocations are given [here](DoS.md). Your HDR UK DoS will work alongside your University Supervisor/Lead to support your studies.

<span style="color: blue;">Please contact your DoS after your university enrolment for a meeting. This should normally take place within four weeks of your enrolment.</span>
