## Objectives

In Years 2-4, you will carry out the approved research proposal you developed at the end of Year 1.

## Supervision 

Your day-to-day supervision will be managed by the Lead Academic Supervisor of your research project who will be based at your university. Supervisory conduct and arrangements will be in accordance with your university's own rules.

## Progression 

You will need to meet your university's normal progression requirements as part of your PhD. Your Graduate Studies Office should inform you of these requirements.

## Reporting Requirements

It is intended that reporting to HDRUK will be light and leverage information that will be generated as part of your normal university progression monitoring.

At the end of each academic year, you and your Lead Academic Supervisor will provide a written report using the HDRUK reporting template on your progress and identify objectives for the following year where relevant. In Year 2, there will be an additional interim report by month 6 describing your progress at the start of your research. In addition, at the start of Year 4, you with your Lead Academic Supervisor will provide a thesis write-up plan.

## Changes in research plan

Research plans can change and evolve over time and HDRUK are happy to support alterations in your research agenda where this is driven by genuine scientific or personal need. You and your supervision team should inform HDRUK of any significant alterations to your research proposal so that the Programme Director can approve such changes and ensure that the research modifications remain consistent with the Programme's health data science remit.

## Training

HDRUK will run a Leadership Programme course during Years 2-4. This programme is intended to develop your skills in communication, networking, influencing and management. Vital capabilities that are crucial to developing you not only as technical experts in your areas of research but to be future leaders in your sectors. This programme is led by academic, clinical and industry experts. HDRUK will also support you with additional ad hoc training workshops and activities throughout the rest of your PhD.

## Support

HDRUK Programme Directors will meet with you individually *at least* once per year to discuss your progress and to identify opportunities where the power of the national institute can be leveraged to enhance your research. We encourage all students to meet with their University Lead annually as well. 

## Transitions

Wellcome and HDRUK-funded studentships provide a *transition fund* to support you at the end of your PhD to move into the next phase of your career. This is a non-trivial research support award that could enable you to set up activities such as an internship or short postdoctoral research position to explore post-PhD career options. More details will be provided at the end of Year 3.
