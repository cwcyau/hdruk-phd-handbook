## Objectives

The overall objective of Year 1 of the PhD Programme is to develop a three-year PhD research ("thesis") project proposal that you will carry out in Years 2-4. 

Identifying a research project that you will dedicate three years of your life towards can be challenging. You will be supported by your university and HDRUK in these efforts through a number of activities in the first year to help you with this. [See more information on choosing your PhD](phd-choice.md).

Continuation of your funding support from HDRUK beyond Year 1 is dependent only on successfully developing a credible thesis project. There is no coursework or exams.

## Induction

The two-day induction meeting at the start of your studies is an opportunity for all HDRUK staff and students to meet each other for the first time. It will cover a range of scientific and administrative matters, including overviews of HDRUK's priority research themes and data-resources, and how to make the most of students' opportunities to connect with like-minded students, across the programme and on other programmes within their home unversities. We will also begin to start cohort development activities to ensure you keep networked as a group throughout your studies. 

<span style="color: blue;">**Post-induction checklist:** </span>

1. You should be provided with an HDRUK e-mail address,
2. You should get access to the HDRUK PhD Slack channel,
3. You should be given permission to access the HDRUK Box file service.
4. Information about the HDRUK Expenses system.


Contact the Programme Team (phd@hdruk.ac.uk) if you do not receive any of this information.

## University-based activities

At the start of Year 1, you will work with your HDRUK University Lead to develop a bespoke programme of activities that will support your ability to choose a thesis project. 

Each university will have different facilities and resources at its disposal to support this so we are not prescriptive but the following examples provides guidance on what might be suitable:

1. Two rotation projects, spanning 8-12 weeks, one in Autumn and one in Spring based within different research groups within your university,

2. Graduate-level courses, for example offered as part of a Centre for Doctoral Training, given insights into different research areas,

3. Participation in externally-led short projects via the HDRUK community or other partners.

You may also want to propose your *own* training regime and we will be happy to support this in discussion with your University Lead and the HDRUK Programme Director.

## Workshops

HDRUK will host a series of short workshops throughout the year to give insight into different areas of scientific research carried out by members of our community across all four nations of the UK as well as external partners organisations (e.g. NHS Digital). These could be lunch-time seminars to full or half-day residential events. The aim is to give you insight into assets which are available nationally within or linked to HDRUK that you could access as part of your PhD research.

## Immersions

Immersion Weeks are extended residential training events lasting 3-4 days. There are normally at least three such events in Year 1. Topics vary from year to year and determine by the immersion event lead but, for example, past immersions have included:

- "Clinical Prediction Models" by the Centre for Health Informatics at the University Manchester,
- "Public Health Data Science" from Statistical Science and Institute of Health Informatics at UCL,
- "Bioinformatics" by the European Bioinformatics Institute.

Cohort building events may also be held alongside immersion weeks.

## Research Project Proposal

You will need to produce a formal written research proposal by the end of Year 1 giving details of your research plans in Years 2-4 and the supervision team that will support the project and you. [See more information on developing your research proposal](progression.md).

### PPIE Training

An important part of your research proposal will be the lay abstract and the addition of appropriate public-patient co-design and engagement activities. We will leverage the extensive experience of HDRUK to support your training in this area through our PPIE team and our Public Advisory Board to ensure your proposals are written and presented suitably for wider audiencs.

### Proposal Review Panel

Your thesis project proposals will be assessed by both the Programme Director and a multi-institutional panel of University Leads or External Experts. The aim of the viva is to provide feedback on your project so that you may improve your research plans (where necessary) before the proposal is submitted to Wellcome. 

You may submit your proposal for review in either June or August of your first year. The first deadline allows time for substantial revisions should the project be assessed have deficiencies or permit PhD studies to begin by the summer. The second deadline allows students flexibility to spend longer on first year activities to support project development but does not leave substantial time for revisions should proposals be unsuitable.

<span style="color: red;">**HDRUK approved Research Proposals must be submitted by the 30 September to Wellcome at the end of your first year. Failure to do so may jeopardise continuation of funding support.**</span>

## Away Week

We will hold an annual retreat each summer to support cohort development. These might include a team building exercise at an outdoor education centre or an international visit to a scientific centre.
