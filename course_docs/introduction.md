# HDRUK-Turing Wellcome PhD Programme in Health Data Science

<br>

I am excited to welcome you to the start of your doctoral studies with [Health Data Research UK](http://www.hdruk.ac.uk) (HDRUK) and our seven partner universities: [Queen's Belfast](https://www.qub.ac.uk/), 
[Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/), [Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), [Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), 
[Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), [Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) and [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). 

The programme is funded by the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk/) and champions their principles of scientific excellence and changing research culture for the better.

Each of you is both a member of the HDRUK community and a postgraduate research student at your university. What this will mean in practice is somthing we will discover together in the months ahead as a group -- this is a ground breaking and novel PhD programme. 

My hope and expectation is that each of you will benefit from being a member of two distinct but overlapping cohorts leveraging both your local university environment and the national structure of HDRUK to become the future leaders of health data science.

Over the four years of your studies you will work towards developing and implementing an exciting research project at your  university but, with our support at HDRUK, we hope to enhance that experience by helping to increase the level of your scientific insight through access to national level expertise and infrastructure, strengthen its impact on the public and patients and to support your development as individuals.

We wish you the best at the very start of this journey.
