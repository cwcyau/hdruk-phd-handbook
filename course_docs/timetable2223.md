## Expenses

Unless otherwise specified accommodation for all residential training events will be booked in advanced by HDR UK for all students who do not normally reside in the town or city where the event is being hosted, i.e. Manchester students would not be booked accommodation for an Immersion Week in Manchester.

Travel to and from your normal place of residence for residential training events can be claimed via your university or HDR UK. All travel associated with your training event can also be reclaimed.

A maximum of *£35* can be claimed for a full day of subsistence (breakfast, lunch and dinner).
